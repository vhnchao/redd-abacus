**REDD Abacus SP** is a public domain software developed by the [World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)](http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea) to:
  * Estimate emission from land use and land cover changes allowing for dynamic heterogeneity of soil types, elevations, climate and other biophysical characteristics in the landscapes
  * Analyze trade-offs between emissions and financial gain (opportunity cost analysis) and produce abatement cost curves Project ex-ante emissions and financial gain of business-as-usual scenarios for setting Reference Emission Level (REL)
  * Simulate zone-specific policies and other emission reduction scenarios within the landscapes, and estimate the potential emission reductions and opportunity costs of them

**REDD Abacus SP** can serve as a main tool in:
  * Developing land use plan for low emission development strategies at the province or district level
  * Assessing carbon efficiency of a large scale land-based enterprise
  * Estimating abatement cost of emissions from land use/cover changes at a regional level
