Opportunity costs refer to the potential economic gains that could be made if certain types of land use change are not happening, e.g. as part of an emission reduction program. If the opportunity costs are low relative to the amount of emission reduction that can be achieved by avoiding this category of land use change, it may be of interest to stakeholders of emission reduction to offset the opportunity costs and make contracts that secure that the carbon remains stored. The difference in economic value ($/ha), per unit avoidable emission (tCO2e/ha) takes the dimensions of a price ($/tCO2e). If the economic value of emission reduction elsewhere (e.g. on a virtual ‘carbon market’) is higher than the opportunity costs of avoiding emissions in a certain landscape, it may be financially attractive for all parties to develop contracts that ensure local emission reduction. Several other elements of price (implementation and monitoring plus transaction costs) also play a role, but if opportunity costs are higher than going market prices, discussions of economic incentives for voluntary emission reduction will be a non-starter.

Opportunity cost curves indicate how much emission reduction might be feasible at what price. The basis for their constructing is '1' The differences in economic value ($/ha) and '2' Time-averaged C stock (t C/ha) of any type of '3' land use change. The land use change may have occurred (if the opportunity cost is a retrospective analysis of recent history) or is deemed plausible in a forward looking scenario of land use change.

REDD Abacus was developed to analyze the opportunity cost of land use changes in a landscape or area within a period of time and generate the abatement cost curve using

  1. A legend that represents land use change from the perspective of economic (‘land use) as well as carbon storage (‘land cover’) perspectives, and that allows land use change data to be compiled by a combination of land cover change detection and economic constraints (e.g. labour requirements in relation to human population density)
  1. Typical carbon stock data for each legend unit
  1. Net Present Value for each land use type, typically using a private (= farm gate) accounting stance  and/or a social (= national economy) one

A matrix of land use change values, that are internally consistent and represents either historical change or a forward looking scenario.

With these inputs, the program performs four steps (see the diagram):
  1. Convert differences in carbon stocks into estimated emissions.
  1. Construct a table of opportunity costs for every type of land use change from the differences in NPV and C stocks
  1. Determine the actual emissions for each cell in the matrix from the area involved and the emissions per unit area
  1. Present the cumulative emission total after sorting by opportunity cost

Together these four steps lead to a two-dimensional graph charting the opportunity costs of avoiding deforesting land-use changes against volume of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions.

_Steps in deriving an opportunity cost (Op-cost) curve that relates the changes in economic profitability (net present value) and typical carbon stocks of land-use (LU) systems, to a land-use change matrix that describes the changes that have occurred (for a retrospective Op-cost curve) or might occur (for a scenario Op-cost curve)._

As indication of a feasible level of economic incentives, a price level of US$ 5/tCO2e, is used as default leaving some space for transaction and implementation costs. The user can easily adjust this price level and evaluate the consequences.
